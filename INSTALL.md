## Requirements

This app uses font symbols and emojis. Therefore, font configuration is the primary requirement.

- Set your default terminal font to a nerd font.
  - For installation check the nerd-fonts github repository: [ryanoasis/nerd-fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).
  - Alternatively they are available on the nerdfonts website: [nerdfonts.com/font-downloads](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).
  - For installation via `brew`, see below.
- A Unicode symbol font needs to be available on the system.
  - If none is installed by default, noto font packages are usually available via your distribution's package manager.

### Debian based distros

- Install package and font dependencies

  ```
  sudo apt install libssl-dev pkg-config fonts-noto-core
  ```

- When using the binaries from the release page, you may need to add libssl manually

  ```
  wget http://nz2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.16_amd64.deb ; sudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.16_amd64.deb
  ```

### MacOS

- Install cask-fonts, a unicode symbol font and a nerd font
  ```
  brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
  brew install font-noto-sans-symbols-2    # Required when using e.g., iterm2 / alacritty
  brew install font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font    # Or any other nerd-font
  ```

## Installation

There are several alternatives to `cargo install wthrr` from crates.io.

- Prebuilt binaries for GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows can be downloaded from the the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/tobealive/wthrr-the-weathercrab/releases).

- If you are on NetBSD, a package is available from the official repositories.
  To install it, simply run
  ```
  pkgin install wthrr
  ```
- A Nix flake is also available
  ```
  nix profile install "github:tobealive/wthrr-the-weathercrab"
  ```
  ```
  nix run "github:tobealive/wthrr-the-weathercrab"
  ```
- Use cargo to install the from souce
  ```
  cargo install --git  https://github.com/tobealive/wthrr-the-weathercrab.git `
  ```

### Build from source

Another way is to compile the app yourself.
Assuming the rust toolchain is installed on your system, just clone the repo and build the release version.

```
git clone https://github.com/tobealive/wthrr-the-weathercrab.git
cd wthrr-the-weathercrab
cargo build --release
```

When the build has finished, you'll find the `wthrr` binary inside the `./target/release` directory.

The same result is achieved by calling Cargo directly using the following
command.  Cargo will execute the same steps in the background such that only one
instruction needs to be executed.

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/tobealive/wthrr-the-weathercrab
```
