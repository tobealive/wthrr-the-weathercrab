## How to use?

**Just call**

```
wthrr
```

With no further arguments added, wthrr will use the [config](https://github.com/tobealive/wthrr-the-weathercrab#config) that's saved as default.<br>
If you haven't configured anything yet, wthrr can try to search for a weather station near you and save the searched location as default.

**Its always possible to specify an address.** E.g.,

```
wthrr melbourne
```

Depending on the place you are looking for, you might need to be be more specific.
For example, the above call will get Melbourne in Australia. If you are aiming for Melbourne in the US, ask for `melbourne,florida`.
If the address contains spaces, separate them with a hyphen or enclose them in quotation marks (e.g., "new-york" or "new york").

If a default address is configured, but you want to explicitly search for a weather station nearby, call

```
wthrr auto
```

Example that uses Fahrenheit and mph as units and adds the hourly forecast for the day

```
wthrr -u f,mph -f -d
```

<sup>\*Rendering and colors are influenced by the terminal used and its theme and font.<br>
For example, the first screenshots show wthrr in nvim(toggleterm) inside kitty with a Dracula theme and JetBrainsMono Nerd Font. The last screenshot shows wthrr in Yakuake / Konsole, also with a Dracula color scheme.</sup>

## Config

Values such as address and units can be stored as defaults in wthrr's config file by adding the `-s` flag to a run.

E.g., on GNU/LinuxThe the location usually is `~/.config/weathercrab/wthrr.toml`

```toml
address = 'berlin' # Address to check the weather for
greeting = true # Greeting message display [true | false]
language = 'en' # Country code of the output language ['de' | 'pl' | ...]

[units]
temperature = 'celsius' # Temperature units [celsius | fahrenheit]
speed = 'kmh' # (Wind)speed units [kmh | mph | knots | ms]
```
