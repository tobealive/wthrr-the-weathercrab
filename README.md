`wthrr` lives in your terminal and her passion is meteorology.

If you spend time in the TUI, you'll have a little companion nearby who knows about the weather.

## How to use?

**Just call**

```
wthrr
```

When no arguments are specified wthrr will use the [config](https://github.com/tobealive/wthrr-the-weathercrab#config) that's saved as default.<br>
If you don't have anything configured yet, wthrr can try to search for a weather station close to you and save the last searched location as default.

**Its always possible specify a address with your call.** E.g.,

```
wthrr melbourne
```

Depending on the searched location, you might want to be be more specific.
For example, the call above will give you Melbourne in Australia. If you are aiming for Melbourne in the US, ask for `melbourne,florida`.
For cities containing spaces, write it separated with a dash or wrap it in quotation marks (e.g., `new-york` or `'new york'`).

If there is a default address configured, but you want wthrr to explicitly search for a nearby weather station, you can do so by calling:

```
wthrr auto
```

## Showcase

<table>
  <tr>
    <th align="center">First Run</th>
    <th align="center">Hourly Forecast</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img alt="" width="400" src="preview/first-run.png" />
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img alt="" width="400" src="preview/hourly.png" />
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="center">Week Forecast</th>
    <th align="center">*Rendering Based on Terminal, Theme and Font</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img alt="" width="400" src="preview/week.png" />
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img alt="" width="400" src="preview/yakuake.png" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<sup>\*Rendering and colors will depend on the used terminal and its theme and font.
For example, the first screenshots show wthrr running in nvim(toggleterm) inside kitty using a dracula theme and JetBrainsMono Nerd Font. The last screenshot shows wthrr in yakuake / konsole, also using a dracula color scheme.</sup>

## Config

Most users will probably not need to bother changing the configuration file manually, since adding the `-s` flag saves the values of a run as default.

For the sake of completeness, the contents of the configuration file are listed below.
The location (e.g., on GNU/Linux ) usually is: `~/.config/weathercrab/wthrr.toml`

```toml
address = 'berlin' # Address to check the weather for
greeting = true # Greeting message display [true | false]
language = 'en' # Country code of the output language ['de' | 'pl' | ...]

[units]
temperature = 'celsius' # Temperature units [celsius | fahrenheit]
speed = 'kmh' # (Wind)speed units [kmh | mph | knots | ms]
```

## Requirements

This app uses font icons and emojis. Therefore, having a font with Unicode support installed and using a nerd variant of your terminal font is required to display the output correctly.

-  [nerd fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
-  [unicode font](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/blob/main/fonts/NotoColorEmoji.ttf)<br>
   <sup>(If it's not installed by default, noto font packages are usually available via your distribution's package manager)</sup>

#### For ubuntu based distros:

-  ```
   sudo apt install fonts-noto-core libssl-dev
   ```

-  When using the binaries, you may need to add libssl manually
   ```
   wget http://nz2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.16_amd64.deb ; sudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.16_amd64.deb
   ```

## Installation

Without the rust toolchain installed, grabbing a binary from the [release](https://github.com/tobealive/wthrr-the-weathercrab/releases) page might be your way to go.

Otherwise, rusts package manager is a simple way to install the binary crate:

```
cargo install wthrr
```

If you are on NetBSD, a package is available from the official repositories.
To install it, simply run:

```
pkgin install wthrr
```

A Nix flake is also avaiable:

```
nix profile install "github:tobealive/wthrr-the-weathercrab"
```

```
nix run "github:tobealive/wthrr-the-weathercrab"
```

### Build from source

Another way is to compile the app yourself.
Assuming the rust toolchain is installed on your system, just clone the repo and build the release version.

```
git clone https://github.com/tobealive/wthrr-the-weathercrab.git
cd wthrr-the-weathercrab
cargo build --release
```

When the build has finished, you'll find the `wthrr` binary inside the `./target/release` directory

## Outlook

The [issues](https://github.com/tobealive/wthrr-the-weathercrab/issues) section lists some of the features that is being worked on.

Contributions like üêõbug reports, ‚≠êÔ∏èstars and üí°suggestions are welcome alike!
